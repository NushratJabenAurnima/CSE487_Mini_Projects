# 🧠 Mini Project 3 — Ethical Limits of Social Media Monitoring

This mini project explores the **ethical challenges of social media monitoring**, focusing on the balance between **user privacy**, **civil rights**, and **public safety** in modern digital platforms.

The analysis was conducted as part of the course **CSE487: Cybersecurity, Law, and Ethics** and applies established **professional ethical frameworks** to evaluate real-world surveillance practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to critically examine:

- Whether large-scale social media monitoring is ethically justified  
- How excessive surveillance can impact privacy, freedom of expression, and trust  
- Under what conditions monitoring may be acceptable for public safety  

The project emphasizes **ethical decision-making in computing**, rather than technical implementation.

## 🧩 Ethical Dilemma Overview

Social media monitoring involves the systematic analysis of publicly available online content by governments, law enforcement agencies, and private organizations.

While such monitoring can help combat:
- Cybercrime
- Terrorism
- Hate speech
- Misinformation

it also raises serious concerns regarding:
- User privacy
- Data misuse
- Algorithmic bias
- Discrimination against marginalized communities

This project addresses the **conflict between public safety and individual rights**.

## 👥 Stakeholder Analysis

The analysis considers the impact of social media monitoring on multiple stakeholders, including:

- **Social media users** — privacy, autonomy, psychological safety  
- **Government & law enforcement agencies** — threat detection vs abuse of power  
- **Social media platforms** — legal responsibility and data governance  
- **Marginalized communities** — risk of biased or unfair targeting  
- **General public** — safety, trust, and civil liberties

## ✅ Group’s Ethical Decision

The project concludes that **social media monitoring is ethically acceptable only when**:

- It is **limited and purpose-specific**
- Supported by **legal authorization**
- Follows **data minimization and retention policies**
- Includes **transparency and accountability mechanisms**

Unrestricted or mass surveillance is considered **ethically unjustified**.

## 🛡️ Criticism and Defense

The report addresses key criticisms such as:
- Reduced public safety due to limited monitoring  
- Insufficient evidence retention  
- High operational costs of ethical compliance  

Each criticism is systematically defended using ethical reasoning and professional standards.
